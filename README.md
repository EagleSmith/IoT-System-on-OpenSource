#How to Use IoT System--Based on the OpenSource Hardware
===================

IoT (Internet of Things) system is one of Wireless Sensor Sytems (WSN). Based on the open source hardware, like Arduino, Raspberry pi, Beaglebone, and so on, anyone can conveniently buit up his own IoT system by using such WSN platform.

##User Guidance 

Step One: [Get API Key] (http://www.iot.fm/ext/examples/desktop/desktop.php), which will be used in the control protocol; 

Step Two: Add sensor nodes, such as smoke, temperature,gas.

Step Three: Design nodes control protocol. By this protocol, we can control the sensed information (e.g., temperature, or gas), please see the [protocol degsin](##Protocol Design).

Step Four: Data Dsiplay. In this step, you can use simple clicks to see the results exhibition, which are shown intuitively by pie figure.
